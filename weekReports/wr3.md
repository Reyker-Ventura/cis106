# Week Report 3 

## summary of presentations 
The linux has different an open sources operating system. The virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality and create a virtual computer system. Desktop environment a complete ecosystem of software and resources providing a homogeneous graphical user experiences. The managing software is help for automating project planning amd scheduling.
## Introduction to Linux
 
 **What is an operating system?**
An operating provides all fundamental software features of a computer. An OS enables you to use the computer's hardware providing you the basic tools that make the computer useful. All of those features relay on the OS's kernel. Other OS features are owed to additional programs that run atop the kernel.

 **Define the following terms: Open Source, Closed source, free software**
open sources- the software may be distributed for a fee or free. The source code is distributed with the software.
closed sources- the software is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code.
free software-the software is distributed with the source code. Thesoftware can be free of charge or obtained.
 **What are the 4 freedoms defined by the free software foundation?**
The 4 freedoms defined by the free software foundation is use the software for any purpose, examine the source code and modify it as you see fit, redistribute the software and redistribute your modified software.

### The basic of Virtualization 
 **What is virtualization?**
The virtualization as creating virtual versions of something. Often used let multiple OSs run on one physical machine at same times.
 **List 3 benefits of virtualization**
Allows running multiple OSs on one machine without dual booting. Allows application to be tested before installing them on a host machine. Reduce costs by degreasing the physical hardware that must be purchased for a network. 
 **What is a hypervisor?**
The hypervisor is a software or Hardware in charge of creating, managing, and running virtual machines.
**What is virtualbox**
The virtualbox is a powerfull x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is Virtualbox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.

### Exploring Desktop Environments

**What are the official flavors of Ubuntu?**
The official flavors of Ubuntu is Mate.
### what is a shell?
**What is Bash?**
The bash is shells make large-scale IT possible. They're a necessary component to modern computing. But it might not have turned out that way without a lot of hard work from a developer at the free software foundation named Brian Fox. Now, the Bash shell is shipped with with with almost every computer in the world.
**How do you access the Linux CLI?**

**what is a console terminal?**
